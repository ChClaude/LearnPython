IDENTIFIERS RULES

-   Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.

-   Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.

-   Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.

-   If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.

PYTHON COMMENTS

-   Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them   : #This is a comment
-   Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments. To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line
    e.g: #This is a comment
         #written in
         #more than just one line

VARIABLES
-   Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
        e.g: x = 4 # x is of type int
             x = "Sally" # x is now of type str

-   String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes : x = "John" # is the same as x = 'John'
